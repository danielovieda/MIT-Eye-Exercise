# MIT Eye Exercise

### Description: Small javascript application that tracks the mouse movement and moves an "eye" element contained within a div.

**How to use:** Download repo and open the index.html in any js compatible browser. Move mouse around inside of the browser window and voila!

Roadmap:

Future improvements include:

- Add button to change the color of the eyes
- Add movement tracking to unlock special gestures
  - Example: Move mouse in a circle to make eyes go crazy for 3 seconds
